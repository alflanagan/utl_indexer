"""
Module to maintain a JSON file of meta-information in a site directory.

We store certified packages in the certified/ directory to prevent duplication, etc. We can set
up symlinks from the site directories to the packages in certified/. That, however, is kind of
fragile (what if certified/ moves? etc.) so we should have a standard place to record the
certified packages from the site (and of course it allows us to record the version used even if
the certified library is not yet installed.)

This database could easily be extended to store other metadata about the site.
